# DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - Launch Assistant to Vercel

## What You Have
A complete, ready-to-deploy Launch Assistant app in the `launch-assistant-deploy` folder.

## Step-by-Step Deployment (Takes 2 Minutes!)

### Step 1: Download Your Files
1. Download the entire `launch-assistant-deploy` folder from Claude
2. Save it somewhere you can find it (like your Desktop)
3. Make sure you have ALL the files inside the folder

### Step 2: Go to Vercel
1. Open https://vercel.com in your browser
2. You should already be logged in with your new account
3. You'll see your dashboard

### Step 3: Import Your Project
1. Click the big "Add New..." button (top right)
2. Select "Project" from the dropdown
3. You'll see "Import Git Repository" - IGNORE THIS
4. Scroll down and look for "Import" or "Deploy" section
5. Click "Browse" or drag & drop your `launch-assistant-deploy` folder

### Step 4: Configure (Auto-Detected!)
Vercel will automatically detect:
- Framework: Vite
- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Output Directory: `dist`

**YOU DON'T NEED TO CHANGE ANYTHING!** Vercel is smart and will set this up automatically.

### Step 5: Deploy
1. Click the big blue "Deploy" button
2. Wait 30-60 seconds while it builds
3. Watch the progress (it's fun to see!)
4. When you see "Congratulations!" with confetti 🎉 - you're LIVE!

### Step 6: Get Your URL
1. You'll see your app URL (something like: `launch-assistant-abc123.vercel.app`)
2. Click the URL to test it
3. Share this URL with your students!

## What Happens Next?

✅ Your app is now LIVE on the internet
✅ Students can visit the URL anytime
✅ Their progress saves automatically in their browser
✅ You can update it anytime by re-deploying

## Adding a Custom Domain (Optional - Do Later)

Once you test and love it, you can add your own domain:
1. Go to your project in Vercel
2. Click "Settings" → "Domains"
3. Add your domain (like `launch.yourdomain.com`)
4. Vercel gives you DNS instructions
5. Update your domain settings
6. Done!

## Troubleshooting

**If deploy fails:**
- Make sure you uploaded the ENTIRE folder, not just some files
- Check that package.json is included
- Try the Vercel CLI method instead (see README.md)

**If you get stuck:**
- Vercel has amazing support docs at https://vercel.com/docs
- Or just ask me and I'll help!

## Need to Update Your App Later?

1. Make changes to the files
2. Go back to Vercel dashboard
3. Click your project
4. Go to "Deployments"
5. Re-upload the folder
6. New version goes live!
